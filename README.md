# PONG-JS-NO-LIBS

You can see the game running in action if you open the index.html file in your browser of choice. Only player 1 can be controlled so far using "W" and "S".

Try to get yourself familiar with the code in game.js. There are "//@TODO's" marked in the code. These should be solved to get a fully functioning pong (please fork the repo and complete it).
